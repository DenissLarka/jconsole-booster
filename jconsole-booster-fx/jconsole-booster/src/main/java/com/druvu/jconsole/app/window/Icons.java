 * The toolbar's glyphs, built as inline {@link SVGPath} nodes: no icon font, so nothing extra to ship or to keep

 * Phosphor Icons, MIT License; see {@code NOTICE.md}), duotone weight, each icon's two paths copied verbatim (256-unit
 * viewBox). A fresh node is returned on every call, because a node lives in one place of the scene only.
 *
 * <p>The colour comes from the stylesheet through the {@value #STYLE_CLASS} style class, so the glyphs follow the
 * theme; a fill set here would beat the stylesheet.
